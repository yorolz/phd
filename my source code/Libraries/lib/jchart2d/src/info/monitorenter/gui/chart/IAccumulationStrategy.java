/**
 * Design helper to deal with the following: If a trace is unsorted then you
 * have to accumulated all n consecutive points into one regardless whether they
 * jump large distances in the value domain. The output might look like
 * something that has nothing in common with the original trace without
 * accumulations. Accumulation then is done just by deflating n consecutive
 * points (see {@link AccumulationStrategyAmountOfPoints}).
 * <p>
 * If a trace is sorted then accumulation may be done based on value regions.
 * Consider you have sorted ascending x values that have a high density of
 * tracepoints in certain regions but a very low density in other regions. If
 * you would accumulated just n consecutive points you would thin out the
 * regions with very little data points (low density) to become even less
 * precision in those large regions while the regions with high density only
 * loose little information. If you decide to split up the visible range in to
 * parts with same value-span then you can just accumulate depending on the
 * density of x values. You will not loose data in value-ranges with low density
 * but are able to drop lots of unnecessary values in high-density areas (see
 * {@link AccumulationStrategyXRangeWithRespectToDensity}).
