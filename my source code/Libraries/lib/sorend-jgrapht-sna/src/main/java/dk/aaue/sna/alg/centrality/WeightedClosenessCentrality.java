 * This implements a closeness centrality for weighted networks, as proposed in [1]. This algorithm assumes that weights
 * are positive. a weight 0 means absence of edge, and a weight of 10 is twice as strong as a weight of 5.
 * <p>
 * See {@link WeightedClosenessCentrality#setAlpha(double)} to control the alpha parameter (default 1.0).
 * For {@code 0 < alpha < 1}, the number of edges are penalized and for {@code alpha > 1} the number of edges are
 * favorized.
