INTRODUCTION
------------

AbcDatalog is an open-source, Java-based implementation of the logic programming
language Datalog. It provides ready-to-use implementations of common Datalog
evaluation algorithms, including efficient multi-threaded versions of bottom-up
and magic set transformation techniques. Additionally, it is designed to be
easily extensible with new evaluation engines and new language features. We hope
that it proves to be useful for both research and pedagogy.

AbcDatalog is released under a BSD License, a copy of which is included in this
directory.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

AbcDatalog must be compiled with Java 8. In addition, the included build script
requires Ant 1.9.0+.


COMPILATION
