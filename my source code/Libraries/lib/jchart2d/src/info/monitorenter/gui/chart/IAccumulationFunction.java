/**
 * Interface for functions that may accumulate several
 * <code>{@link ITracePoint2D}</code> instances into one.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This is for example needed to let
 * <code>{@link ITrace2DDataAccumulating}</code> combine several tracepoints
 * into one.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Note that this does not describe the state-of-the-art plain interface for
 * accumulating trace points (or even generic data) but is designed in a
 * stateful manner that allows user-code to work on trace points in a stream
 * based manner. So the design might look (and be) a bit hard to use / not-self
 * explanatory. But this is done with performance in mind.
 * <p>
 * <b>How to use</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create an instance.</li>
 * <li>
 * Start iterating over your own {@link ITracePoint2D} instances (user code
 * should be in the iterator implementations of {@link ITrace2D}
 * implementations). Iterate in the following manner:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Reset your loop counter for the amounts of points to accumulate.</li>
 * <li>Check if the current point is within proper bounds / visible / not NaN.</li>
 * <li>In case it is valid feed it to this function via
 * {@link #addPointToAccumulate(ITracePoint2D)} and increment your point
 * counter.</li>
 * <li>Check if you have accumulated enough points. If so, then get the
 * accumulated point via {@link #getAccumulatedPoint()} and return it from your
 * iterator. As a side effect the accumulation function is in the state empty
 * again, ready for accumulation of the next n points.</li>
 * <li>In case you are implementing an iterator for a trace that is sorted (by x
 * -value) and your counter is not full but your loop has no more points to
 * iterate return the last real point your own loop iterated. This is needed
 * because the contract of {@link ITrace2DDataAccumulating#iterator(int)} .</li>
 * <li>done!</li>
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
